This talk is probably not for you.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

**So listen.**  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

<!-- Note -->

I want to state one thing upfront:

* I’m sorry, this talk, or most of it, is — probably — not for you.

  I mean don’t get me wrong, I totally do want to talk to you and I
  appreciate that you’re listening to me, but you’re at
  Cephalocon. You came here to talk about Ceph, listen to people talk
  about Ceph, meet Ceph people — chances are, you’re not new to Ceph.

  So it’s possible that what I’m talking about isn’t for you — but for
  the colleague who couldn’t come along, the engineer that will be new
  to Ceph when she joins your team next month, the acquaintance from
  IRC who can’t travel to a Ceph conference from Indonesia or
  Paraguay, or maybe even your kid in college.

* So listen to me anyway.

My name is Florian, and in 2015, my team and I set out with an idea:
we’d been doing a lot of training, for the better part of 3 years, on
Ceph, on OpenStack, and related technology. But we’d done it in a
conventional way, with a group of perhaps 5-10 people, seated in a
room, listening to a consultant-slash-instructor.

So basically, what we were trying to be, to our customers, was the
know-it-all.
