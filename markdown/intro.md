<!-- Note -->

I’m sorry, this talk is — mostly — not for you.

I mean don’t get me wrong, I totally do want to talk to you and I
appreciate that you’re listening to me, but you’re at Cephalocon. You
came here to talk about Ceph, listen to people talk about Ceph, meet
Ceph people — chances are, you’re not new to Ceph. 

So it’s possible that what I’m talking about isn’t for you — but it’s
quite possibly for the junior colleague you just hired, the
fantastically capable engineer that will be new to Ceph when she joins
your team next month, the underprivileged acquaintance from Slack or
IRC who can’t travel to a Ceph conference from Indonesia or Paraguay,
or maybe even your kid in college.

My name is Florian, and I’ve been working with Ceph, and learning
about it and explaining it to others since 2012.
