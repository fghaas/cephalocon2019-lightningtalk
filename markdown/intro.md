# Sorry <!-- .element class="hidden" -->
This talk is probably not for you.  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

**So listen.**  <!-- .element class="fragment" -->

<!-- Note -->

I want to state one thing upfront:

* I’m sorry, this talk, or most of it, is — probably — not for you.

  I mean don’t get me wrong, I totally do want to talk to you and I
  appreciate that you’re listening to me, but you’re at
  Cephalocon. You came here to talk about Ceph, listen to people talk
  about Ceph, meet Ceph people — chances are, you’re not new to Ceph.

  So it’s possible that what I’m talking about isn’t for you — but
  it’s for the junior colleague you just hired, and for whom travel
  budget wasn’t sufficient to come along, the fantastically capable
  engineer that will be new to Ceph when she joins your team next
  month, the acquaintance from IRC or Slack or the mailing list who
  can’t travel to a Ceph conference from Indonesia or Paraguay, or
  maybe even your kid in college.

* So listen to me anyway.

My name is Florian, and I’ve been working with Ceph, and learning
about it and explaining it to others since 2012.
