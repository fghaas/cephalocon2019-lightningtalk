# 2015 

<!-- Note --> 

In 2015, my team and I set out with an idea: we’d been doing a lot of
training, for the better part of 4 years, on Ceph, on OpenStack, and
related technology. But we’d done it in a conventional way, with a
group of perhaps 5-10 people, seated in a room, listening to a
consultant-slash-instructor. You know, trying to be the know-it-all.

<!-- Note --> 
And while that is admittedly a very effective
means of knowledge transfer *when it happens,* it has a ton of
drawbacks. 

Because if this is our principal means of how we want to spread
knowledge about technology, then we’re up against three massive
issues:


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/cost.svg" data-background-size="contain" data-timing="5" -->

<!-- Note --> 
Cost, 


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/speed.svg" data-background-size="contain" data-timing="5" -->

<!-- Note --> 
speed, 


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/scale.svg" data-background-size="contain" data-timing="5" -->

<!-- Note --> 
and scale. Because the conventional, instructor-driven training method is
terrible at all three.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/costspeedscale.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

<!-- Note --> 
First it’s really expensive to get good instructors, and then there’s
only so many people available that are actually good at this. Many of
them are here in the room, book them if you can. But even a super
smart chap like Wido here won’t easily be able to train a hundred
people in a week, all of whom speak Pŭtōnghuà (Mandarin Chinese), so
that’s a scale issue.

Then it means disruption. You’re getting pulled out of a project for
three days or even a week. And the people on your team have to step in
the breach. Or worse, your whole team does go off for training but
you’re *still* expected to keep the ship afloat and then your learning
experience is ruined because you need to tend to issues all the time.

And then it takes tons of time. And that’s not the training session or
class itself, but the preparation, the scheduling, the wait for an
available instructor, all that. So that’s cost.

So there’s another way to do this, and that’s on-line learning. But oh
my lord is online learning frequently terrible.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/video_based.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

<!-- Note --> 

It often hinges on learners watching an instructor talk on video.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/learning.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
<!-- Note -->
And self-studying documentation. And that's how you're supposed
to understand and be able to manage increasingly complex distributed
systems. Without ever actually touching one that you can also break with
impunity.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/astronaut_training.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

<!-- Note --> 
It's almost like putting astronauts in a lecture hall with study
books and a few tabletop exercises, ...


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/astronaut_strapped.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->

<!-- Note --> 
and then strapping them to a rocket and hurling them into space
without them ever setting foot in a realistic simulator.

That's a broken model. So what do we really need?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/help.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
<!-- Note --> 
We need learning environments that actually help you learn the technology
that you want and need to learn.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/immersive.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
<!-- Note --> 
That come with immersive, realistic lab environments.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/interact_with_peers.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
<!-- Note --> 
That allow you to interact directly with your peers, in your
learning environment, just as you would in your professional group.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/system.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
<!-- Note --> 
... and do all that ...


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/open_source.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
<!-- Note --> 
... with the momentum and speed of open-source platforms that innovate
rapidly and openly.
