<!-- Note --> 
And people liked it! And we could make our own little contribution to
spreading the word about Ceph. And more than zero people who sat in
one of our classes back then did a keynote at this very conference. So
I guess we did OK. But:

While that — that is to say hands-on, face-to-face, instructor-driven
training — is admittedly a very effective means of knowledge transfer
*when it happens,* it has a ton of drawbacks.

Because if this is our principal means of how we want to spread
knowledge about technology, then we’re up against three massive
issues:


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/cost.svg" data-background-size="contain" data-timing="5" -->

<!-- Note --> 
Cost, 


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/speed.svg" data-background-size="contain" data-timing="5" -->

<!-- Note --> 
speed, 


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/scale.svg" data-background-size="contain" data-timing="5" -->

<!-- Note --> 
and scale. Because the conventional, instructor-driven training method is
terrible at all three.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/costspeedscale.svg" data-background-size="contain" data-timing="20"-->

<!-- Note --> 
First it’s really expensive to get good instructors.

Then it means disruption. You’re getting pulled out of a project for
three days or even a week.

And then it takes tons of time (think prep, scheduling, all that).

So there’s another way to do this, and that’s on-line learning. But oh
my lord is online learning frequently terrible.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/video_based.svg" data-background-size="contain" data-timing="5" -->

<!-- Note --> 

It often hinges on learners watching an instructor talk on
video. Essentially one person just chatting away at a static camera.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/learning.svg" data-background-size="contain" data-timing="10" -->
<!-- Note -->
And self-studying documentation. And that's how you're supposed
to understand and be able to manage increasingly complex distributed
systems. Without ever actually touching one that you can also break with
impunity.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/astronaut_training.svg" data-background-size="contain" data-timing="10" -->

<!-- Note --> 
It's almost like putting astronauts in a lecture hall with study
books and a few tabletop exercises, ...


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/astronaut_strapped.svg" data-background-size="contain" data-timing="10" -->

<!-- Note --> 
and then dragging them out of the lecture hall, strapping them to a
rocket and hurling them into space without them ever setting foot in a
realistic simulator.

That's insanity. We’d never do that. And yet, it’s remarkably close to
how a lot of technology training works. So what do we really need?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/system.svg" data-background-size="contain" data-timing="15" -->
<!-- Note --> 
We need learning environments that actually help you learn the technology
that you want and need to learn.

That come with immersive, realistic lab environments that you can
interact with just like you would with production systems.

That allow you to interact directly with your peers, in your
learning environment, just as you would in your professional peer group.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/open_source.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
<!-- Note --> 
... and do all that with the momentum and speed of open-source
platforms that innovate rapidly and openly.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/openedx-logo.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
<!-- Note --> 
And we built one! Based on the Open edX platform. 

(Which is a whole separate talk in itself. So much cool stuff in
there, particularly if you’re a Python person. But! I digress.)
