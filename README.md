# Learn Ceph â€” For Fun, For Real, For Free!
Lightning Talk

Since early 2018, City Cloud Academy has offered an entirely self-paced Ceph Distributed Storage Fundamentals course with fully interactive labs at no cost to 25 community members each on a first-come, first-served basis. We're making it easy to get your first start on Ceph, and we're looking for feedback on how to get better!
